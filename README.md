Credit Risk Analysis Report

Overview:
The goal of this analysis is to asses the credit risk associated with lending activities. By using ML techniques, I developed a predictive model that can classify loan applicants into low-risk(healthy loans) and high-risk categories. I'm trying to give insight for what borrowers are the lowest risk, allowing the company to make the most informed decisions regarding who they'll approve for loans and risk management strategies. 

Based on the high accuracy, precision, and recall scores achieved by the machine learning model, it is recommended for use by the company. The model demonstrates exceptional performance in accurately identifying both healthy and high-risk loans. With a precision of 0.85 for high-risk loans, the model effectively minimizes false positives, reducing the risk of approving loans to potentially risky borrowers. Additionally, the high recall score of 0.99 indicates that the model successfully identifies almost all high-risk loans, minimizing the likelihood of false negatives. Overall, the model's robust performance makes it a valuable tool for improving loan approval decisions and mitigating credit risk for the company.
